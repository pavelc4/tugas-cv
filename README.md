To get this project up and running, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):

## Usage

### Development Mode

To start the development server and watch for changes in your CSS (Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI will be compiled automatically):

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will generate `dist/output.css` and update it whenever you make changes to your HTML or `src/input.css`.

### Build for Production

To build the optimized CSS for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate the final `dist/output.css` file.
